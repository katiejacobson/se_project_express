# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

Project #12: This project creates a basic server for the WTWR application. An Express server was created and connected to a database that was created. The routes for users and clothing items were configured and controllers for the routes were created. Additionally, basic error handling was added.

Project #13: This project adds on to the previous one by allowing users to signup, signin, and attaches an owner id to specific cards so only the owner can delete the card.

**Description of Techniques**
Project #12: Express.js was the framework that was utilized to create the server. A modular approach was used for routes and controllers while mongoDB and mongoose were used to create the database. A temporary authorization solution was created with authorization middleware, which allowed a user object to be added to each request. This will allow owners of cards and unique likes to be recorded.

Project #13: Authentication and authorization steps were added so that the user schma now includes an email and password, which was hashed using cryptjs. A JSON web token was created upon login with an expiration date and authentication allows users to change their name and avatar as well as delete their own cards.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature
